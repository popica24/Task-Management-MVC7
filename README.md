# Project Idea: Task Management Application

## Description

Create a web-based task management application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The application allows users to create, update, and track tasks in a collaborative environment.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Implement user registration and login functionality to allow users to create accounts and authenticate themselves.

- **Task Management:** Provide functionality to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have properties such as a title, description, due date, priority, and status.

- **Dashboard:** Create a dashboard where users can view their tasks, categorized by their status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed). The dashboard should display task details and provide options to update or delete tasks.

- **Template Pattern:** Implement the Template Pattern to define a base task template that includes common behavior and properties. Subclasses can then extend the template to provide specialized behavior for specific types of tasks (e.g., personal tasks, work tasks).

- **State Pattern:** Apply the State Pattern to manage the lifecycle of a task. Define different states such as "to-do," "in progress," and "completed," and allow tasks to transition between these states based on user actions.

- **Command Pattern:** Utilize the Command Pattern to implement undo and redo functionality for task modifications. Maintain a command history stack and provide options to revert or reapply changes.

- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS:** Use JavaScript for interactive features and client-side validation. Implement HTML templates for rendering views and CSS for styling the application.

By incorporating OOP principles and design patterns like the Template Pattern, State Pattern, and Command Pattern, you can ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will provide the necessary front-end interactivity and aesthetics.
